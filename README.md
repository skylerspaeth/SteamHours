# SteamHours
Node.js server app for a web widget that counts how much time you've spent on Steam in the past 2 weeks, then displays it with no other UI elements for use in Mac OS X Dashboard or elsewhere.
Once you have a Steam API key, `mv example_settings.json settings.json` and update both the token and user ID.
